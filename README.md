The purpose of this challege was to successfully perform an analsysis of risk, returns, and market sensitivity of 4 whale funds as compared to the S&P 500 between the years of 2014 - 2017. The code and final report was created using jupyter notebook to create report. Notebook contains code, detailed analaysis, and responses to specific challenge questions.

## Technologies 

This project leverages python 3.7 specifically and assumes that jupyter lab has been installed.

## Installation Guide
To review challenge 4 clone the repository and run the **risk_return_analysis.ipynb** using the following command: 

```python
str("conda activate dev")
str("jupyter lab")
text = python risk_return_analysis.ipynb
print(text)
```
## Usage

Once the book is run, several charts will be generated as example seen below. Final analysis will illustrate why my final recommendations is to add the Berkshire Hathaway Fund and the Tiger Global Funds to our portfolio of funds offered.
