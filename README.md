The purpose of this challege was to successfully perform an analsysis of risk, returns, and market sensitivity of 4 whale funds as compared to the S&P 500 between the years of 2014 - 2017. The code and final report was created using jupyter notebook to create report. Notebook contains code, detailed analaysis, and responses to specific challenge questions.

## Technologies 

This project leverages python 3.7 specifically and assumes that jupyter lab has been installed.

## Resources

* Data provided by Columbia FinTech program [here.](https://github.com/ssenhouse/challenge-4-041323/tree/main/Starter_Code/Resources)
 
## Contributions 

Historical data and challenge questions provided by Columbia FinTech progam.
Analysis, code, and conclusions completed by Sean Senhouse

## Installation Guide
### To review challenge 4:

First initialze the dev environment and the Jupyter lab  

```python
str("conda activate dev")
str("jupyter lab")
```
Open the Jupter Notebook titled: **risk_return_analysis.ipynb** 
Run all of the code

## Usage

Once the book is opened, the book is broken up into several sections:
* Import the csv file data.
* Analyze the Performance of the funds as compared to the S&P 500
* Analyze the return volatility of the funds
* Analyze the Risk-Return Profile
* Conclude fund recommendations
Several charts will be generated as example seen below. The chart below shows the cumulative returns of the 4 whale funds and the S&P 500. Upon conclusion of my analysis, my recommendation is to add both the Berkshire Hathaway Fund and the Tiger Global Funds to our portfolio of funds offered. Both of these funds offer retirement investor different options based on their risk profile, specifically "Are the clients close to retirement, or do clients have a longer retirement horizon."
